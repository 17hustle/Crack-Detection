# Crack-Detection
A project based on crack detection of images

Dataset: Images of cracks in concrete 
Classes : Two -> Crack and no crack images
Size: 40,000 RGB images in total with 20,000 crack (positive, y=1) and remaining without crack (negative, y=0)

Challenges: 
  1. Cracks can be confused with noise in the image, foreign objects or texture of the surface.
  2. Inhomogeneous illumination
  3. Irregularities
